This was an individual project from the CISC 375 Web Development class at University of St. Thomas. The project's goal was to build a static personal website using HTML, CSS, and Foundation framework. The website should have a home page, a project demonstration page, a resume page, and personal page to share more about myself. The website is also responsive with smaller screensizes like phone or tablets.
