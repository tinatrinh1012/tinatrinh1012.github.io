# tinatrinh1012.github.io

This project was an individual project from the CISC 375 Web Development class that I took at University of St. Thomas. The project's goal was to build a static personal website as a career porfolio using HTML and Foundation CSS framework. The website should have a home page, a project demonstration page, a resume page, and personal page to share more about myself. The website is also responsive with smaller screensizes like phone or tablets. Since it's a static website, Github was used to host the website live. The website is accessible at https://tinatrinh1012.github.io.
